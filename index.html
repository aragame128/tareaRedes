        <h1>SMART CITIES</h1>
        <p>Smart cities are the result of the increasingly urgent need to orient our lives towards sustainability. Thus, these cities use infrastructure,
		innovation and technology to reduce energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions..</p>
		<p> 
		</p>
		<p>A Smart City can be described as the city that applies the information technologies <strong>(IT)</strong> and communication technologies <strong>(ICT)</strong> in order to provide 
		it with an infrastructure that guarantees:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>A sustainable development.</li>
          <li>An increaase in the quality of life of citizens.</li>
          <li>Greater efficiency of avaivle resources.</li>
		  <li>Active citizen participation </li>
        </ul>
		<p> Therefore, they are cities that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Smart City is born from the need 
		to maintain a harmony between these aspects. </p>
        
        <h3>INDICATORS </h3>
        <p>In collaboration with Barcelona, Buenos Aires and other major cities around the 
		world, Boyd developed a set of indicators to support the comparative evaluation 
		of smart cities. Digital cities can be identified (or categorized) in six 
		dimensions. </p>
		<ul>
          <li>Digital economy.</li>
          <li>Digital mobility.</li>
          <li>Digital ecosystem.</li>
		  <li>Digital citizenship.</li>
		  <li>Digital life.</li>
		  <li>Digital governance.</li>
        </ul>
		
		<h3>ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES </h3>
		<p>What advantages do Smart Cities give us? </p>
		<ul>
			<li>New services that respond better to the specific needs of citizens 
			with a considerable time saving according to tasks.</li>
			<li>Improves energy saving and energy efficiency.</li>
			<li>Improvement in the management of mobility and urban parking, 
			to improve traffic and reduce the time spent searching for a parking 
			space, minimizing queues and waiting times at municipal offices and 
			health centers. </li>
			<li>It is intended to progress urbanism and environment. More and 
			improve the green areas and peripheral areas </li>
			<li>Reduction of the expenses that a property and electricity can 
			generate.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>What are the disadvantages of Smart Cities? </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reduction of the intimate nature of people. "To be more 
			effective, it must be observed what habits the consumer has in all 
			its aspects and levels".</li>
			<li>Real estate becomes more expensive. They are more complex 
			to execute and build.</li>
			<li>Greater technological gaps between cities and realities.</li>
			<li>They generate a significant increase in electronic waste 
			at the same time.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (IT).</h3>
		<p>They are the information technologies that will assist in 
		the moment of supervising the different subsystems that make up 
		the capital, through which citizens and administrative entities 
		can actively participate in the control of the city.</p>
		<p>A city can be qualified as digital (or smart) when it invests in 
		human and social capital, in traditional (transport) and modern 
		infrastructures (ICT), in fuel communications infrastructure, in sustainable 
		economic development and a high quality of life, with rational management 
		of natural resources, through participatory management.</p>
